# Open Source SW Lecture2 Summary
One repository is not necessarily created by one person, but can be created, modified, and supplemented by several people.

README.md file contains the contents of the document on the first screen that you see when you open the repository.

### How to create a repository
1. Create a new repository from scratch.
2. Press the 'use this template' button to create a repository using the existing repository as a template.
Method 1 is commonly used.
In the case of method 2, the contents in the existing repository are put in the newly created repository, so if you modify the contents in the newly created repository, the contents in the existing repository are not affected.

### Four steps
Step 1: Create a branch

When you first create a repository, a branch called main is created by default.
Create a new branch to prevent the contents of the main branch from turning into unwanted results when developing new features or trying to handle errors.
The code and information in the main branch come to the new branch.

Step 2: Commit a file

Commit is a kind of snapshot that records the process so that you can go back to that point at any time when you develop SW.
Commit is usually done whenever there is a change.

Step 3: Open a pull request

Pull request is to ask the main branch manager to integrate the contents of the new branch into the main branch when he thinks that the contents of the new branch have been completed to some extent.

Step 4: Merge your pull request

Merge is to integrate the newly created branch into the main branch.
